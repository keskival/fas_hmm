# Multinomial Hidden Markov Model Evaluation

This repository implements an evaluation of a multinomial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for simulated interleaved process traces.

The simulation dataset is generated by this project: https://github.com/keskival/FAS-Simulator

Get the data by following the instructions there to get the directory named `numpy_data`.

Run the evaluation: `./train_hmm.py`

The script will save trained models for further evaluation.

This produces outputs to the standard output giving log likelihood minimums, means and maximums for 100 faultless runs in the validation set, and 100 runs with simulated errors, for each number of HMM hidden states from 1 to 64.

If the scored log likelihood ranges overlap, it means that HMM is not able to perfectly discriminate between the correct and failure mode runs.
